# Cookies and Sessions
Broadly speaking, there are two ways to implement sessions: store everything in the
cookie, or store only a unique identifier in the cookie and everything else on the serv‐
er. The former are called “cookie-based sessions,” and merely represent a convenience
over using cookies

# Sessions 
* Used for storing login authentication information such as logged in or not so that the client does not have to reload the page everytime.
* We'll be using sessions which are nothing but sorted and secure cookies.
* cookies with a unique identifier
